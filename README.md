# Next.js Dynamic Route Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications when using dynamic routes and custom components. The error, 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')', arises when attempting to map over an array that is undefined or null. This issue typically happens due to data fetching problems or incorrect data handling within the component.

## Bug Description
The `pages/index.js` file contains a component that fetches data and attempts to render it using the `map` method. In cases where the data hasn't been fetched successfully, or is null, the `map` method throws an error.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing proper error handling to check for the existence of data before attempting to map over it.  We add a conditional rendering to gracefully handle the case where the data is still loading or is null.
